# Flutter Image Display 

A simple Flutter application that showcases how to display images from both local assets and remote network URLs. The app includes examples of styling images with rounded corners and shadows, as well as implementing loading and error handling for network requests.


## Features

- Display images from local app assets (Image.asset).
- Display images from network URLs (Image.network).
- Apply advanced styling with BoxDecoration for a polished look (e.g., borderRadius and boxShadow).
- Implement a loading indicator while a network image is being fetched.
- Handle network errors gracefully with a user-friendly error message.
- Uses SingleChildScrollView for a responsive layout on various screen sizes.
## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- A code editor like VS Code or Android Studio.
